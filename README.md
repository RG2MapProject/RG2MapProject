# RG2MapProject
Goals:
Create a multi-layered map of Lithuania, each layer containing markers of towns,
each of which display some information derived from RG2 when clicked on.
Content:
.kml file 
sample .html file that (should but I'm not a java coder so some things are weird)
makes a map with the .kml overlay with a box on the side that displays the
click text. (Code adapted from Google Maps Java API guide, link below)
